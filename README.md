# VBA-challenge
Week 2 homework
After working with my tutor I was able to successfully run the VBA scripts to produce the following summary tables with the alphabetical dataset

However, following the session I realized that I saved the file as xlsx and not xlsm and lost my macros
I developed new scripts included in this repo however I kept getting an overflow error for the volume variable even though I made it a long variable
I consulted with two learning assistants and we were not able to debug the code so I was therefore unable to produce the requested tables with the stock market data
